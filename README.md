# BLE Android Plugin for Godot Engine

This repository contains an Android plugin that gives the possibility to use BLE in [Godot applications](https://godotengine.org).
The module to build and use is the one contained in the directory `bleframework/`.


## Setup

### Android Studio Version and setup

The BLE Android Plugin consists of an **Android Archive Library (AAR) that is built with Android Studio using the project in this repository. Android Studio projects have many options that must be considered to  make the project build successfully. In particular the following variables must be carefully considered:

- The Android Studio Version itself
- The Gradle version used by Android Studio
- The Gradle Plugin version used by Android (this on its turn constraints the usable Gradle version)
- The Gradle project configuration ( in particular: compileSdkVersion, buildToolsVersion, minSdkVersion, targetSdkVersion )
- The Android SDK location
- The Android NKD location
- The Android JDK location
- Android Android Platform and SDK Tools (versions of the Android SDK Build Tools, Android SDK Platform Tools, SDK command line tools, NKD etc) 
- Java SDK Version Installed on the System


### Building the plugin in Android Studio

After downloading this repository, open the relative folder with Android Studio, and then build the module **bleframework**. Once the operation is done, you will find the **Android archive library** (*aar* archive file) in *bleframework/build/outputs/aar/*.

### Android Environment in Godot

In order to build an Android application, you need to set up the Godot environment as explained [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/export/android_custom_build.html).

### Loading the plugin

Move the plugin configuration file (`bleframework/bleframework.gdap`) and the local binary (`bleframework/build/outputs/aar/bleframework-debug.aar`) that you generated to the Godot project's `res://android/plugins` directory (if they do not exist, create them).
The Godot editor will automatically parse the **.gdap** file and show our plugin **"BLE Plugin"** in the Android export presets window under the **Plugins** section.
Once you enable it, you can use it in your code as explained in the next section.

## How to use the plugin

The plugin makes available the main functionalities for an Android device (central) to connect and communicate with a peripheral.
The main functionalities are:
- start scanning / stop scanning
- set filters for the scanning
- connect/disconnect to/from a device
- enable/disable characteristic's notifications (and receive them)
- read/write a characteristic

To use the plugin in Godot, in your script you have to retrieve the correspondent singleton, as shown below.
``` gdnative
if Engine.has_singleton("BLEPlugin"):
    var ble = Engine.get_singleton("BLEPlugin") 
    ble.initialize()
```

The variable `ble` is the object that contains all the methods of the Java class, through which you can access the BLE operations.

Since the Android BLE library uses many callbacks in Java, in those cases they carry meaningful information a signal is emitted so that it can also be seen in Godot. To receive these signals and thus perform some actions, the signal has to be connected to a function in the Godot script as shown below.
```gdnative
ble.connect("device_found", self, "_on_dev_found")
```
In this way, when the signal "device_found" is emitted, the function "_on_dev_found" is instantly executed.
